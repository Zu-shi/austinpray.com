Just some notes from installing Arch Linux. Will come back and clean this article up.

## GUI and Graphics

Nvidia GTX 1070 -> install `nvidia` package. `nvidia-libgl` fine.

`lightdm` + `i3` + `termite`

## Japanese Fonts

Don't forget your Japanese fonts if you are listening to future funk. `sudo pacman -S adobe-source-han-sans-jp-fonts`
