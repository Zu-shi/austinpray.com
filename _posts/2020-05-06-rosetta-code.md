I'm constantly bouncing between Ruby, PHP, Python, JavaScript for work. I consider myself a pretty good polyglot programmer: but I can't keep the entire standard libraries for all these languages in my head at all times. This post is my own personal [rosettacode.org](https://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code) for when I have to google stuff.
